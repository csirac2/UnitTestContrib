%TOC%

The Foswiki Unit Test Framework consists of a set of test support packages and scripts, and a number of unit test packages that test many of the features of Foswiki.

At the time of writing this package can only be used with Foswiki 1.1. (Foswiki 1.0 has its own version of UnitTestContrib).

---++ Usage

To run the unit tests, =cd= to =test/unit= and type =perl ../bin/TestRunner.pl !FoswikiSuite.pm=. 
The !FoswikiSuite package will collect all the other tests in the =test/unit= directory and run them. 
Any test failures are reported during the test run and again at the end of the run.

---+++ Options

*-clean*: Sometimes sessions in a live Foswiki hang around, or a test can fail leaving fragments of fixtures behind. 
These sessions and fragments may stop the tests from being run again, as the tests require an cleanroom environment to run in. 
You can instruct the test runner to clean up any fragments passing =-clean= to =TestRunner.pl= - but use it with great care, as it deletes webs and files from =/tmp= without waiting for confirmation from you!

*-log*: Normal test output is printed to the console, so you can redirect it to a file. 
This is hard to do on some platforms, so the =-log= option is provided. This saves all the test output (STDOUT and STDERR) to a logfile. 
The logfile is named for the exact time the test run started. Remember that logfiles can get quite large. 
The logfile can also be useful when you are analysing unexpected output from subprocesses, as it blocks any attempt to redirect to the null device.

---++ Details

The =TestRunner.pl= script accepts a list of the names of test files in the current directory. 
It performs some preliminaries and environment checking before invoking a =Unit::TestRunner= that does the real work. 
This class iterates over the list of test files, and runs the tests. It maintains a record of any failures, and reports them at the end of the run.

Test files are built by deriving a class from =Unit::TestCase=. 
This is usually done via =FoswikiTestCase= or =FoswikiFnTestCase=, which are fixture-building classes designed specifically for use when testing Foswiki. 
=FoswikiTestCase= is used for tests where the Foswiki configuration ($Foswiki::cfg) must be saved and restored; it is also responsible for making sure the default plugins (and only the default plugins) are enabled. 
=FoswikiFnTestCase= is used where we are already fairly confident that basic Foswiki work, and we need some pre-registered users and pre-created test webs containing data that the test can work on.

!FoswikiSuite automatically includes any Plugin tests it can find in subdirectories below =test/unit=. 
This is helpful when you want to test a plugin in context with all the other core unit tests.

One test file, =SemiAutomaticTestCaseTests.pm=, reads the semi-automatic tests from the !TestCases web stored in subversion. 
It will not run if it can't find the !TestCases web, or if the Foswiki:Extensions.TestFixturePlugin is not installed.

---++ Browser-in-the-loop tests

Tests derived from =FoswikiSeleniumTestCase= use [[http://seleniumhq.org/projects/remote-control/][Selenium Remote Control]] to exercise Foswiki via one or more browsers.
These tests only execute if one or more browsers are [[%SCRIPTURLPATH{"configure"}%#UnitTestContrib$Extensions][configured]] in $Foswiki::cfg{UnitTestContrib}{SeleniumRc}{Browsers},
which tells the perl Selenium client (Test::WWW::Selenium) where to find the !SeleniumRC server for each browser and how the server should launch the browser.
The default value is blank (i.e. no browsers), so these tests are skipped by default.
If any browsers are specified, then each test derived from =FoswikiSeleniumTestCase= is executed via each browser.

If you configure any browsers in $Foswiki::cfg{UnitTestContrib}{SeleniumRc}{Browsers}, then you are responsible for starting !SeleniumRC server on the
corresponding machines (the servers will launch the browsers automatically, and close them automatically when the tests are finished).
The browser-in-the-loop tests will fail if they cannot connect to the servers.

Each browser is specified by means of a hash which supports the fields listed below. 
See [[http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?WWW%3A%3ASelenium#METHODS][the WWW::Selenium documentation]] for more information.
| *Field name*  | *Description* | *Default value* |
| =host=        | Name or IP address where the selenium server is running | localhost |
| =port=        | Port number   | 4444 |
| =browser=     | Command for launching the browser, which would typically be "*firefox", "*iexplore" or the path to the browser. See the WWW::Selenium documentation for more info. | *firefox |
| =browser_url= | The starting URL, including just the domain name - the domain must be the same as the wiki to be tested | $Foswiki::cfg{DefaultUrlHost} |

Here is an example configuration with three browsers: =FF= is Firefox running on the same machine that runs the unit tests, 
=IE= is Internet Explorer running on another machine and =FFwindows= is Firefox running on the same machine as Internet Explorer
(they use the same !SeleniumRC server).
<verbatim>
{
    'FF' => { },
    'IE' => { 'host' => 10.0.0.3, 'browser' => '*iexplore' },
    'FFwindows' => { 'host' => 10.0.0.3, 'browser' => '*firefox' },
}
</verbatim>

Use the =SeleniumConfigTests= to verify your configuration.
